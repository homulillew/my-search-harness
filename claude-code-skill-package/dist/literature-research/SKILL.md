# Literature Research

Use this skill when the user asks for an academic literature review, technical-route
survey, state-of-the-art analysis, research landscape, or evidence-backed technical
report. Claude is the semantic Researcher; the Python Harness is the deterministic
runtime for authority, persistence, stable references, provenance, accounting, and
validation.

Never edit `state.json`, event logs, report artifacts, or repository files directly.
All authoritative mutations must go through the Python harness entrypoint; host Web
observations remain ephemeral until promoted with `retain-papers`.

## Harness entrypoint

Invoke the harness through its single Python entrypoint. Resolve the installed
Skill directory, then run `scripts/harness.py` with the available Python
interpreter:

```text
python "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/harness.py" --workspace PATH COMMAND [OPTIONS]
```

`harness.py` resolves the bundled Runtime itself and, if a Skill-local `.venv`
exists (created by `python scripts/setup.py`), switches to that interpreter
automatically before executing the command. The caller never needs to know the
venv interpreter path. `CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR` is an optional override of the Skill
root; otherwise `harness.py` resolves it from its own location. On Windows
PowerShell, Linux, and macOS the same command works; if the host exposes Python
as `py` rather than `python`, use that interpreter. See `RUNTIME_API.md` for the
command schemas.

## Read the protocol before acting

Read only the supporting material needed for the current stage:

- [Research protocol](references/RESEARCH_PROTOCOL.md): contracts, adaptive search,
  source reading, synthesis, recovery, and the outer loop.
- [Runtime API](references/RUNTIME_API.md): commands, JSON input shapes, revision
  handling, and error behavior.
- [Completion guide](references/COMPLETION_GUIDE.md): the independent completion
  boundary and PASS / CONTINUE / UNCERTAIN criteria.
- [Report writing guide](references/REPORT_WRITING_GUIDE.md): the authoritative style
  and editorial standard used by all semantic writing stages.
- [Research integrity guide](references/RESEARCH_INTEGRITY_GUIDE.md): evidence-strength,
  benchmark, comparison, causality, recency, and high-risk claim checks used by the
  independent Research Integrity Reviewer.

## Start from the request

Treat `$ARGUMENTS` as the user's research request. If it is empty, ask for the topic,
intended audience, scope, and desired deliverable. Otherwise infer a conservative
initial Research Contract and state the important assumptions before creating it.

Convert the request into:

1. a precise mission;
2. independently checkable requirements;
3. an explicit in-scope / out-of-scope boundary;
4. a deliverable description;
5. required artifacts, normally `REPORT` for a written survey.

Do not encode fixed paper counts as completion conditions. Workload expectations can
guide exploration, but coverage, evidence quality, recency, contradiction handling,
and requirement satisfaction determine completion.

Run the environment check first:

```text
python "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/harness.py" --workspace workspace doctor
```

Create a run using a JSON file, not shell-escaped inline JSON:

```text
python "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/harness.py" --workspace workspace create-run \
  --input /tmp/research-contract.json
```

Keep runtime data in the chosen workspace, never inside the skill directory.

## Own the semantic outer loop

The Harness does not prescribe a fixed research finite-state machine. Claude owns an
adaptive outer loop:

```text
view current state
→ identify the highest-value uncertainty or gap
→ search, inspect, or read evidence for that uncertainty
→ retain selected papers and synthesize durable research objects
→ reassess coverage and contradictions against updated State
→ repeat, request completion, or explain a blocker
```

Each turn of this loop is one research iteration: it starts from a specific uncertainty,
acquires evidence for it, and updates State before the next turn. Do not run the loop as
a pipeline where a discovery phase feeds a fixed analysis phase. Choose the next action
from the reassessed State, not from the previous step's momentum.

After every state-changing command, use the returned `state_revision` for the next
command. On a revision conflict, discard the stale plan, call `view`, and reason again.

## Keep discovery inside the research loop

A search call is not a research iteration. For deep research, do not finish a broad
discovery batch before beginning source reading and synthesis. After each meaningful
evidence cluster: integrate durable State, reassess current uncertainty, and let that
updated State choose the next search or read action. Discovery, Primary Source reading,
synthesis, and reassessment should interleave throughout the run.

The failure mode to avoid is staged batching: search a broad batch → retain all → batch
analysis → one synthesis → request completion. That collapses the adaptive outer loop
into a pipeline and lets volume substitute for judgment. A broad discovery sweep may
contain multiple search calls inside one research iteration, but it must end by returning
to State reassessment, not by proceeding to a fixed analysis stage.

## Search through independent discovery channels

Use DeepXiv through `search-papers` first. It remains the primary scholarly semantic
search, pagination, source inspection, and targeted reading path. Begin broadly, learn
canonical routes and terminology, then expand by mechanism and explicit date windows.

Use Claude Code native `WebSearch` as an independent frontier counter-recall channel,
not a second authoritative paper database. For explicit latest/current/recent/SOTA
requests, always perform at least one Web frontier counter-search in addition to a
DeepXiv recent sweep. Also use it when retained recency is suspiciously stale, recent
terminology shifts, or a known paper is missing from DeepXiv results.

```text
foundation and route discovery → DeepXiv recent sweep → emerging-term expansion
→ native WebSearch counter-search → WebFetch canonical scholarly page
→ retain selected identity → Harness source verification → gap-driven follow-up
```

Keep this adaptive. Generate Web queries from actual methods, algorithms, rewards,
benchmarks, mechanisms, authors, and emerging terms; use `site:arxiv.org` or
`site:openreview.net` when useful. Prefer native `WebSearch` and `WebFetch`; never call
search engines through Bash or custom APIs.

```text
python "<SKILL_DIR>/scripts/harness.py" --workspace workspace search-papers \
  --run-id RUN --expected-revision REV --query "QUERY" \
  --limit 20 --offset 0 --date-from YYYY-MM-DD --date-to YYYY-MM-DD
```

Search output includes provider-reported `total_count`, and hits include publication
date as well as year when available. Use `total_count`, new unique identities, route
novelty, and recent-paper novelty to decide whether to page; do not mechanically exhaust
all results. A first page is discovery input, not proof of coverage, and local date
sorting of retrieved candidates is not a global latest-paper search.

DeepXiv hits, WebSearch results/snippets, and WebFetch pages are observations, not
evidence. Use WebSearch to find scholarly URLs and `WebFetch` to verify canonical
metadata. Follow blogs, labs, repositories, or news to an arXiv, OpenReview, DOI, or
publisher paper page; never retain the lead or fabricate an unconfirmed field.

Promote an important Web-discovered candidate with the existing `retain-papers` input,
using only verified metadata. Then use `inspect-source` and `read-source` before formal
analysis or claims; WebFetch does not bypass evidence access. If DeepXiv cannot inspect a
retained Web-only paper, record a source coverage gap rather than inventing a fallback.

## Inspect before reading

For a retained paper, call `inspect-source` first to obtain provider-supported sections.
Then call `read-source` with a targeted locator for methods, experiments, limitations,
or another specific need. Read the full source only when the structure is unavailable
or broad context is genuinely necessary.

This is the Primary Evidence Gate: a `PaperAnalysis` with mechanism-level claims,
empirical results, or detailed comparisons must rest on `inspect-source` /
`read-source` evidence, not on the abstract or search metadata that selected the
paper. A paper may be retained on abstract alone, but its detailed analysis may not
be written from the abstract. If primary-source access fails, record a source coverage
gap rather than manufacturing analysis from discovery metadata. `SourceContent` is
ephemeral; convert the evidence that matters into a concise `PaperAnalysis` with
useful `key_locators`, leaving them empty when no targeted locator applies.

## Synthesize periodically

Synthesis is part of each research iteration, not a final stage. After each meaningful
cluster of reading, update the structured landscape before choosing the next action:

- `PaperAnalysis` records what a retained paper contributes, shows, and fails to show.
- `ApproachFamily` groups methods sharing a real mechanism, not merely vocabulary.
- `Finding` records a supported cross-paper technical judgment.
- `OpenProblem` records an unresolved field-level question supported by the landscape.
- `InvestigationGap` records work still required for this run or contract.

An Open Problem belongs to the researched domain. A Gap belongs to the current research
process. Do not substitute one for the other.

Use source relations (`SUPPORTS`, `CHALLENGES`, `QUALIFIES`) and locators to preserve
evidence boundaries. Retire or update obsolete semantic objects through explicit
commands instead of silently changing their meaning.

For a deep technical-route survey, normally seek multiple query formulations, more
than one representative method per major route where the literature permits it,
seminal and frontier evidence, competing results, deployment conditions, and explicit
unknowns. These are exploration heuristics, never mechanical completion thresholds.

For an explicitly deep or comprehensive technical-route survey, a corpus of only a
few investigated papers is normally insufficient unless the scope is genuinely narrow.
Tens of deduplicated search candidates across multiple adaptive searches are a normal
exploration scale for a broad field survey. Before requesting Completion from a much
smaller corpus, the Researcher must be able to explain from the Contract and current
landscape why the scope is narrow enough that additional search is unlikely to reveal
a major route, representative method, disagreement, or recent frontier development.
This is workload guidance, not a paper-count or Completion threshold.

Before requesting Completion for a latest/recent task, answer from the retained corpus:
the newest relevant paper date, the searched recent window, the frontier queries used,
whether emerging terminology triggered follow-up searches, whether pagination added
recent work, whether native Web counter-search found DeepXiv misses, and whether every
important Web discovery was retained and source-verified. This is a Researcher self-check;
the fresh Completion Checker judges only retained state and the structured landscape.

## Resume from authoritative state

When resuming, ignore conversational memory as authority. Recover from:

1. `view` for the current lifecycle, contract, revision, gaps, and landscape;
2. `inspect` for exact objects behind stable references;
3. targeted source reads when evidence must be rechecked;
4. `audit-history` for prior search queries, pagination, filters, and external attempts.

Raw Web results are not recoverable state. Do not repeat searches blindly, but rerun a
needed Web counter-search after resume when a frontier gap remains unresolved.

## Request independent completion

When the Research Contract appears satisfied, call `request-completion`. Completion is a
feedback boundary, not a loop counter: a CONTINUE verdict names concrete blocking gaps
that the Researcher resolves by returning to the loop, and a PASS authorizes Delivery.
There is no forced number of research iterations before completion is allowed, and a
CONTINUE does not reset a counter — it returns specific repair work to the loop.

Then create a fresh checker context that has not participated in the research loop and
follow [COMPLETION_GUIDE.md](references/COMPLETION_GUIDE.md).

The fresh Completion Checker may only:

- call `completion-view`;
- call `completion-inspect` for exact retained objects;
- call `completion-read-source` for targeted evidence verification;
- submit PASS, CONTINUE, or UNCERTAIN.

It must not search, retain papers, mutate research objects, or inherit the Researcher's
private reasoning. It must not use WebSearch or broad Web discovery. CONTINUE must
identify concrete blocking gaps; control then returns to Research. UNCERTAIN is used
when available evidence cannot justify either PASS or a specific repair plan. PASS alone
authorizes complete Delivery.

## Deliver a report

In DELIVERY, build the report from a fresh `delivery-view` and targeted inspections.
Load the two authority documents separately:

```text
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/REPORT_WRITING_GUIDE.md
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/RESEARCH_INTEGRITY_GUIDE.md
```

Apply the complete Writing Guide to the Narrative Planner, Report Composer, Editorial
Integrator, fresh Editor, and Reviser. It governs organization, prose, synthesis, and
readability. Create the independent Research Integrity Reviewer in a fresh context with
the complete Integrity Guide, Delivery state, manuscript, and targeted inspection/source
access. The Integrity Guide is its primary rubric; it does not receive the Writing Guide
as a style rubric and does not perform prose polish.

The semantic stages are:

```text
Narrative Planner
→ Report Composer
→ Editorial Integrator
→ Fresh Editor
→ Reviser when needed
→ Research Integrity Reviewer
→ deterministic citation renderer
→ publish-report
→ validate-delivery
→ close-run
```

If integrity review finds a Delivery-only writing or citation repair, revise in Delivery.
If it finds an unsupported claim or missing research, call `reopen-research` and return
to the research loop.

The fresh Editor reviews the whole report semantically: sections must be driven by
research questions or judgments rather than paper order; taxonomy must state its
classification criterion; each paragraph should make one main judgment and start with
a self-contained claim; giant paragraphs, abstract-noun chains, bureaucratic or
translated prose should be repaired. Representative methods must serve synthesis,
carry the required first-use hyperlink, and lead naturally from evidence to gaps. These
are editorial judgments, not Python paragraph-length or style validators.

The fresh Integrity Reviewer checks author claims versus independent evidence,
single-paper evidence versus consensus, correlation versus causation, ablation versus
causal mechanism, numerical gains versus statistical significance, SOTA and
generalization scope, benchmark validity, robustness and efficiency dimensions,
test-time compute/tool budgets, comparison fairness, recency and absolute claims,
corpus-bounded absence, and citation-to-claim alignment. It returns the existing typed
integrity result without a numeric score.

Integrity may inspect Delivery state and retained objects, reread targeted sources, and
review the manuscript. It must not search broadly, retain papers, mutate Research state,
create Findings, or silently add evidence. Completion asks whether Research State
satisfies the Contract; Integrity asks whether the report faithfully represents that
accepted State. Keep these authority boundaries separate.

When a retained primary paper has a canonical URL, hyperlink the first formal occurrence
of its method or system name to that URL. This navigation link never replaces a structured
citation. Keep citations close to the technical judgments they support.

Paragraph rhythm, natural Chinese, terminology, title density, and appropriate table use
are semantic editorial criteria. Do not ask the Harness to encode them as structural
validators. Preserve experimental conditions and qualifications while improving prose.

Use `render-report` to resolve structured citation tokens deterministically, then pass
the rendered content to `publish-report`. Only close after `validate-delivery` succeeds.

## Wiki orchestration after closure

After a run closes COMPLETE, project accepted cross-run knowledge into the Wiki. The
Wiki is a rebuildable, non-authoritative Markdown projection of CLOSED+COMPLETE runs,
not a run artifact and not a second research runtime: it never enters the lifecycle, is
not a required artifact, and its failure never breaks a closed run or invalidates the
report. Only CLOSED+COMPLETE runs are eligible; partial runs are excluded.

Call `wiki-projection` to read the current authoritative projection of eligible runs.
The projection carries `source_runs` — the `(run_id, state_revision)` identity of every
eligible run at projection time. Preserve it. Synthesize Wiki pages from that projection
— pages that synthesize accepted approaches, findings, and open problems across runs,
each carrying contributing refs to real research entities. Perform the semantic review
of those pages yourself, against the same projection; this is a Claude-side semantic act,
not a harness command field.

Then call `publish-wiki` with `source_runs` (preserved from the projection) and the
reviewed `pages`. Python validates structure and provenance deterministically and
publishes a versioned local build, recording `source_runs` verbatim in the manifest as
honest build provenance. A published Wiki may become stale if a newer run closes COMPLETE
afterwards; that is allowed — the manifest honestly records which run revisions produced
it. Detect staleness with `is_current()` (or by re-projecting and comparing) and rebuild
when desired. There is no publish-time exact-current rejection: a stale `source_runs` is
published, not refused.

Invalid structure or provenance raises `WikiBuildError` before publication, preserving
any previous Wiki. A rejected semantic review is your decision — do not call `publish-wiki`
until the review passes. Either way the run remains CLOSED COMPLETE and the report remains
valid. See `RUNTIME_API.md` for the input shape.

## Handle failures explicitly

The adapter emits one JSON object to stdout. Successful commands return `"ok": true`.
Failures return nonzero and machine-readable JSON on stderr without a stack trace.

External search and source attempts may advance the revision even when the provider
fails because resource usage is authoritative. Read the error's `state_revision` or
call `view` before retrying. Never replay with a stale revision.

Do not print, persist, or include `DEEPXIV_TOKEN` in JSON input, audit rationale, reports,
examples, logs, or commits. The runtime reads it only from the environment.

## Finish visibly

At handoff, report the run ID, final lifecycle, delivered artifact path, major coverage,
known limitations, and whether completion was PASS, CONTINUE, or UNCERTAIN. If blocked,
name the exact missing environment capability or unresolved research gap.
